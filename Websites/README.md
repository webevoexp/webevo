We perform experiments on 13 websites. Each website folder contains one target web page and its screenshot (old.png), one evloved page and its screenshot (new.png), and three calendar folders. Each calendar folder contains one history web page. Semantic-based Visual Search outputs are in the "target_img" folder and the "candidate_img" folder. "Result and Ground Truth.xlsx" contains the experiment results and the ground truth.
